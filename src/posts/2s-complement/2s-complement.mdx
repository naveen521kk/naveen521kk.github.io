You've probably heard the title elsewhere. Remember someone saying that computer
can't subtract and use "a method" to calculate the difference using addition? I'm going
to describe that "method" in this article; it's called
[Two's Complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) method.


Let's start with how numbers are stored in memory. In computers, the number are
stored in binary (a number with just 0's and 1's) and handled differently for both
signed and unsigned numbers.

### Unsigned numbers

Unsigned numbers are positive numbers including _0_. In C language, the `unsigned` keyword
is used to represent these.

Here, the number is first converted to the corresponding
[binary number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number), and then
directly stored. For example, the below interactive example shows how _45_ is stored:

<UnsignedBinaryRepresentation value={45}/>

The entire memory is used to store the number itself. For example, a `char` in C is usually
_2 bytes_, which is _8 bits_ (4 * _num_ bits). Here, all the _8 bits_ are used to store
the number, which means it can store till _255_ or in other words, it can store from _0_
to _255_.


### Signed numbers

Signed numbers are positive numbers, negative numbers and _0_. In C language, defining a
normally would mean it's a signed number. Usually, signed numbers are represented
using [two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) method.

Here, the number is first converted to the corresponding binary number, ignoring the negative
sign. Then, all the bits are inverted (0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0). The number at this state
is called [One's Complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ones%27_complement). Finally, _1_
is added to the number. Now, this number is called the
[Two's Complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). For negative numbers,
the [MSB (Most Significant Bit)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_significant_bit), usually
the leftmost bit, is set to _1_. For positive numbers and zero, it's set to _0_.


For example, the below interactive example shows how _-45_ is stored:

<SignedBinaryRepresentation value={-45}/>

## Actual Subtraction

The task is to find the difference between two numbers `a` and `b` using 2's
complement method
