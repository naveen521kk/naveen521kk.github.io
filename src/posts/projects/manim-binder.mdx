You can view the project live on the
[Manim Documentation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/examples.html).

Below is a demo video of the project:

## Project's Background

[Manim](https://manim.community) is a powerful animation engine for explanatory
math videos. Currently, one of the biggest challenges for newcomers is the
learning curve. The documentation lacks interactivity (the ability to run code
directly from the documentation), which makes it difficult for users to experiment
with the code and understand the underlying concepts.

The goal is clear: Manim users should be able to try out the examples directly
from the documentation.

## Project Features

The key feature of this project is a button to make the example interactive in
the documentation. Clicking this button opens a code editor below the example code,
allowing users to experiment with the code. There also exists a run button below the
editor. With a simple click, users can execute their code, visualize the output,
and iterate on their animations effortlessly.

This feature significantly improves the learning experience, allowing users to
interactively explore Manim without leaving the documentation. It bridges the
gap between theoretical understanding and practical application, making the onboarding
process smoother for newcomers.

## Project Details

**GitHub Repository:** [Manim Binder](https://github.com/naveen521kk/manim-binder)

**Pull Request:** https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/3427

The project’s core functionality is implemented in TypeScript and compiled into
a minified JavaScript file using Webpack. This file is then included in the Manim
repository, ensuring seamless integration. The approach not only maintains the
cleanliness of the Manim codebase but also allows for efficient updates and
maintenance.

Being an open-source project, Manim Binder is licensed under the 
[MIT License](https://github.com/naveen521kk/manim-binder/blob/main/LICENSE),
encouraging collaboration and use in other projects. This flexibility empowers
the broader community to adopt and adapt the interactive documentation feature
for their needs.

The inspiration for this project stems from the
[Juniper](https://github.com/ines/juniper) project and the
documentation of [spaCy](https://spacy.io/).

The project leverages the Binder API to enable this interactivity, where
users run Manim code in a Jupyter kernel. It not only simplifies the execution
process but also ensures consistency across different user environments.

## Conclusion

This project is to make Manim easy to use without the friction for the users
to install Manim. The interactive code blocks embedded in the documentation
empower users to experiment, learn, and create without problem.
