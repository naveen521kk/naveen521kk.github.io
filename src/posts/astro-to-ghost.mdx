Recently, I undertook a project to convert an Astro website to Ghost. The task
involved building a Ghost theme based on the existing Astro website and enabling
users to create new blog posts and pages.

This post is not about using Ghost as a Headless CMS; we are porting a website
entirely to Ghost.

In this blog post, I'll describe my techniques to achieve this conversion.

## Setting up a Ghost Development Environment

Follow these guides to set up your Ghost development environment:

- [Ghost Local Installation](https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/)
- [Ghost Starter Theme Development Guide](https://github.com/TryGhost/Starter?tab=readme-ov-file#development-guide)

I was working on Windows, so I had to set up Ghost on WSL because `ln` doesn’t
work natively on Windows, and I didn't bother to find the equivalent.

After the setup, you'll have a working Ghost website with a barebones theme.
Any changes made to the theme will reflect directly on the website.

## Ghost Route Configuration

Refer to the documentation at: [Ghost Themes Routing](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/routing/)

This project required a landing page that doesn’t list posts on the homepage. So, I created a `home.hbs` file that inherited from `default.hbs`. To make the homepage render from `home.hbs`, I created the following `routes.yaml` file and uploaded it as specified in the documentation.

```yaml
routes:
  /: home

```

I also wanted the `/posts` page to list blog posts and for all blog post URLs to be prefixed with `/blog`. My final `routes.yaml` file looked like this:

```yaml
routes:
  /: home
collections:
  /blog/:
    permalink: /blog/{slug}/
    template: index

```

The template files we edited were:

- `default.hbs`: The main template file containing the header and footer HTML code
- `index.hbs`: Used for displaying posts
- `home.hbs`: Used for the homepage contents
- `post.hbs`: Used for individual posts
- `page.hbs`: Used for individual pages (a copy of `post.hbs`)

## Migrating Styles

I started by migrating the necessary styles for the entire site. I copied the
production builds of the CSS files into the assets directory (`assets/css`).
You can find the CSS files to copy from either the browser inspect panel or the
build directory of Astro. Then, I added the following to `assets/js/index.js`:

```jsx
import "../css/css-file-1.css";
import "../css/css-file-2.css";

```

The bundler configured in the theme would now include the necessary CSS.

There were some inline styles (created using the `<style is:inline>` tags option
in Astro) which I handled later.


## Migrating HTML Layouts

This part was straightforward. I simply copy-pasted the HTML from the
browser’s inspect panel. Most things worked out without any issues.
However, React components, animations, and other JavaScript-reliant features
didn't work initially.

I did the same for the post listing page (`index.hbs`) and post rendering
pages (`post.hbs` and `page.hbs`) -- without breaking the template present
in there for rendering posts dynamically. This gave an overall structure to the
website. Combined with the styles from the previous step, the site started
to take shape.

## Migrating JavaScript

This project had some plain JavaScript files for animations.

I copied the JavaScript files from the source code into the `assets/js`
directory. Next, I converted them into functions by wrapping all the code in a
function like this:

```jsx
export default function someFunction() {
  // code previously in the file
}

```

I then imported and called those functions in `assets/js/index.js`. This made
most animations and features like the mobile navbar work.

## Migration React Components

For this, I created a small project using the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - React + TypeScript template. I copied the components from the Astro website into this project. Then, I modified `src/main.tsx` as follows:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { NavigationItem } from './navigation-menu';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("navigation-menu-dropdown")!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <NavigationItem />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById("navigation-menu-dropdown-mobile")!
).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <NavigationItem />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

```

Here, `NavigationItem` is the component I ported, and it needed to be rendered in two places. I marked those two places (in `default.hbs` in my case) with a div with an ID like this:

```html
<div id="navigation-menu-dropdown"></div>

```

I configured Vite to generate a single JS file with everything needed. This meant I could include the generated file using a script tag in the HTML, and things would work. Here’s my `vite.config.ts` file:

```jsx
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

// <https://vitejs.dev/config/>
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        dir: 'dist',
        entryFileNames: 'assets/[name].js',
        assetFileNames: 'assets/[name].min.[ext]',
      },
    },
  },
});

```

Next, I ran `npm run build` and copied the JS file in `dist/assets` directory to the theme's `assets/js` directory. I also renamed it as required (`dropdown.min.js`).

In the `default.hbs` file, I added the following line before the closing of the `<body>` tag:

```html
<script type="module" crossorigin src="/assets/js/dropdown.min.js"></script>

```

This made the dropdown in the navbar work as expected.

## Conclusion

This process completed the majority of the homepage. Some parts, like the blog post listing and individual blog posts/pages, required manual attention for styles and animations.

That’s a wrap for this post. I hope you found it useful.
